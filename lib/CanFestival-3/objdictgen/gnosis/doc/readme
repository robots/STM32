Several modules created by David Mertz (with generous contributions by
numerous other programmers--see the various THANKS_TO and HISTORY
strings) have been aggregated into the "gnosis" package.  This allows us
to include various useful supplementary files (documentation, test
cases, utilities, etc), as well as to break large modules into smaller
components.

Over time, additional modules will be included.  Please see the
documentation in the various subpackages for details on usage, changes,
etc.  Subpackage documentation may be viewed in several ways:

    % less gnosis/xml/pickle/doc/HISTORY

or,

    >>> import gnosis.xml.pickle.doc
    >>> print gnosis.xml.pickle.doc.HISTORY

or,

    % pydoc.py gnosis.xml.pickle.doc

Similarly for other subpackages.

As a result of the package organization, the import of modules in older
application will require a slight change to use the newer packaging.
For example, an application might previously have had a line like, e.g.:

    import xml_pickle

Users of the new package can use the following instead, e.g.:

    import gnosis.xml.pickle as xml_pickle

Any remaining code that uses names in the "xml_pickle" namespace should
continue to work with this one change.  Of course, newer applications
might prefer to start using the package namespace descriptions directly.
Other than the leading "gnosis", package names will generally simply
replace underscores in the old-style names with dots in the new-style
subpackages.
