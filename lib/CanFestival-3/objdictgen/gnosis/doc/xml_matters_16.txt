    This article discusses XML-RPC as a way of modelling object
    data.  General background on what XML-RPC does is given.  We
    compare, specifically, XML-RPC as a means of representing
    Python objects--and objects in other languages--with the
    [xml_pickle] module discussed in earlier columns.


Preface: What is XML-RPC?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  XML-RPC is a remote function invocation protocol that has the
  great virtue of being worse than all its competitors.  Compared
  to Java RMI, or CORBA, or COM, XML-RPC is impoverished in the
  data it can transmit and obese in message size.  XML-RPC abuses
  the HTTP protocol to circumvent firewalls that exist for good
  reasons, and as a consequence transmits messages lacking
  statefullness and incurs a channel bottleneck.  Compared to
  SOAP, XML-RPC lacks both important security mechanisms and a
  robust object model.  Just as a data representation, XML-RPC is
  slow, cumbersome, and incomplete compared to native programming
  language mechanisms like Java's 'serialize', Python's 'pickle',
  Perl's 'Data::Dumper', or similar modules for Ruby, Lisp, PHP,
  and many other languages.

  In other words, XML-RPC is the perfect embodiment Richard
  Gabriel's motto "worse is better."  I can hardly write more
  glowingly about XML-RPC than the prior paragraph, and I think
  the protocol is a perfect match for a huge variety of tasks.
  To understand why, I think it is worth quoting Gabriel
  characterizing the "worse-is-better philosophy":

    * Simplicity:  the design must be simple, both in
      implementation and interface.  It is more important for the
      implementation to be simple than the interface.  Simplicity
      is the most important consideration in a design.

    * Correctness:  the design must be correct in all observable
      aspects.  It is slightly better to be simple than correct.

    * Consistency:  the design must not be overly inconsistent.
      Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases,
      but it is better to drop those parts of the design that
      deal with less common circumstances than to introduce
      either implementational complexity or inconsistency.

    * Completeness:  the design must cover as many important
      situations as is practical.  All reasonably expected cases
      should be covered.  Completeness can be sacrificed in favor
      of any other quality.  In fact, completeness must
      sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is
      jeopardized.  Consistency can be sacrificed to achieve
      completeness if simplicity is retained; especially
      worthless is consistency of interface.

  Writing years before the specific technology existed, Gabriel
  identifies the virtues of XML-RPC perfectly.


Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I have written a moderately popular module for Python called
  [xml_pickle].  The purpose of that module (discussed previously
  in this column) is to serialize Python objects, using an
  interface mostly the same as the standard [cPickle] and
  [pickle] modules.  The only difference is that the
  representation is in XML.  My intention all along with that
  module was to create a very lightweight format that could also
  be read from other programming languages (and across Python
  versions).  A DTD accompanies the module for users wanting to
  validate "XML pickles", but feedback from users suggest that
  formal validation is rarely bothered with.

  A recurrent question I have received from users of [xml_pickle]
  is whether XML-RPC would be a better choice, given its more
  widespread use and existing implementations in many programming
  languages.  While the answer to the narrow question probably
  favors [xml_pickle], the comparison is worthwhile--and it
  raises some points about data-type richness.

  On the face of things, XML-RPC would seem to do something
  different than [xml_pickle].  XML-RPC calls remote procedures,
  and gets results back.  This below typical usage example
  appears at the XML-RPC website and in the _Programming Web
  Services with XML-RPC_ book:

      #--------- Python shell example of XML-RPC usage --------#
      >>> import xmlrpclib
      >>> betty = xmlrpclib.Server("http://betty.userland.com")
      >>> print betty.examples.getStateName(41)
      South Dakota

  By contrast, [xml_pickle] creates string representations of
  local in-memory objects.  Those do not seem the same.  But in
  fact, most of what XML-RPC needs to do to call a remote
  procedure is first to convert its arguments to suitable XML
  representations--in other words, pickle/serialize the
  parameters.  A return value from an XML-RPC call can similarly
  contain a nested data structure.  Moreover the '.dumps()'
  method of the [xmlrpclib] is both named identically to an
  [xml_pickle] module (both inspired by several standard
  modules), and does the same thing--write the XML serialization
  without peforming any actual call.

  At a first level of examination, [xml_pickle] and [xmlrpclib]
  are functionally interchangeable--at least if one only cares
  about the serialization aspect.  As we will see, a closer look
  finds some differences.


Representing Objects
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Let us create an object, then serialize it by two means.  Some
  contrasts will come to the fore:

      #----- Python shell example of XML-RPC serialization ----#
      >>> import xmlrpclib
      >>> class C: pass
      ...
      >>> c = C()
      >>> c.bool, c.int, c.tup = (xmlrpclib.True, 37, (11.2, 'spam') )
      >>> print xmlrpclib.dumps((c,),'PyObject')
      <?xml version='1.0'?>
      <methodCall>
      <methodName>PyObject</methodName>
      <params>
      <param>
      <value><struct>
      <member>
      <name>tup</name>
      <value><array><data>
      <value><double>11.2</double></value>
      <value><string>spam</string></value>
      </data></array></value>
      </member>
      <member>
      <name>bool</name>
      <value><boolean>1</boolean></value>
      </member>
      <member>
      <name>int</name>
      <value><int>37</int></value>
      </member>
      </struct></value>
      </param>
      </params>
      </methodCall>

  A few things should be noted already.  First is that the whole
  XML document has a root '<methodCall>' element which is
  irrelevant for our current purposes.  Other than a few bytes
  extra, however, it makes no difference.  Likewise, the
  '<methodName>' is superfluous, but the example gives a name
  that indicates the role of the document.  Moreover, a call to
  'xmlrpclib.dumps()' accepts a tuple of objects, but we are only
  interested in "pickling" one--if there were others, they would
  have their own '<param>' element.  But other than some
  wrapping, the attributes of our object are well contained in
  the '<struct>' element's '<member>' elements.

  Now let us look at what [xml_pickle] does (the object is the
  same as above):

      #----- Python shell example of XML-RPC serialization ----#
      >>> from xml_pickle import XML_Pickler
      >>> print XML_Pickler(c).dumps()
      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <!DOCTYPE PyObject SYSTEM "PyObjects.dtd">
      <PyObject class="C" id="1840428">
      <attr name="bool" type="PyObject" class="Boolean" id="1320396">
        <attr name="value" type="numeric" value="1" />
      </attr>
      <attr name="int" type="numeric" value="37" />
      <attr name="tup" type="tuple" id="1130924">
        <item type="numeric" value="11.199999999999999" />
        <item type="string" value="spam" />
      </attr>
      </PyObject>

  There is both less and more to the [xml_pickle] version (the
  actual size is similar between the two).  Notice that even
  though Python does not have a builtin boolean type, when a
  class is used to represent a new type, [xml_pickle] adjusts
  with aplomb (albeit more verbosely).  XML-RPC, by contrast, is
  limited to serializing its 8 data types, and nothing else.  Of
  course, two of those types--'<array>' and '<struct>'--are
  themselves collections, and can be compound.  There is also the
  little matter that [xml_pickle] can point multiple collection
  members to the same underlying object; but that is absent by
  design from XML-RPC (and introduced in later versions of
  [xml_pickle] also).  As a small matter, [xml_pickle] contains
  only a single 'numeric' type attribute, but the actual pattern
  of the 'value' attribute allows decoding to integer, float,
  complex, etc.  No real generality is lost or gained by these
  strategies, although the XML-RPC style will appeal
  aesthetically to programmers in statically-typed languages.


Weaknesses of XML-RPC
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The problem with XML-RPC as an object serialization format is
  that it just plain does not have enough types to handle the
  objects in most high-level programming languages.  The most
  obvious demonstration of this fact is below:

      #------ Python shell example of XML-RPC overloading -----#
      >>> c = C()
      >>> c.foo = 'bar'
      >>> d = {'foo':'bar'}
      >>> print xmlrpclib.dumps((c,d),'PyObjects')
      <?xml version='1.0'?>
      <methodCall>
      <methodName>PyObjects</methodName>
      <params>
      <param>
      <value><struct>
      <member>
      <name>foo</name>
      <value><string>bar</string></value>
      </member>
      </struct></value>
      </param>
      <param>
      <value><struct>
      <member>
      <name>foo</name>
      <value><string>bar</string></value>
      </member>
      </struct></value>
      </param>
      </params>
      </methodCall>

  Two things were serialized--an object instance and a
  dictionary.  While it is fair enough to say that Python objects
  are particularly "dictionary-like", there is a lot of
  information lost by representing a dictionary and an object in
  -exactly- the same way.  Moreover, the excessively generic
  meaning for '<struct>' in XML-RPC affects pretty much any OOP
  language, or at least any language that has native
  hash/dictionary constructs; it is not a Python quirk here.  On
  the other hand, failing to distinguish Python tuples and lists
  within the '<array>' type of XML-RPC is a fairly
  Python-specific limitation.

  [xml_pickle] handles all the Python types much better
  (including data types defined by user classes, as we saw).
  There is actually no direct pickling of dictionaries in
  [xml_pickle], basically because no one has asked for that (it
  would be easy to add).  But dictionaries that are object
  attributes get pickled:

      #------ Python shell example of [xml_pickle] dicts ------#
      >>> c, c2 = C(), C()
      >>> c2.foo = 'bar'
      >>> d = {'foo':'bar'}
      >>> c.c, c.d = c2, d
      >>> print XML_Pickler(c).dumps()
      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <!DOCTYPE PyObject SYSTEM "PyObjects.dtd">
      <PyObject class="C" id="1917836">
      <attr name="c" type="PyObject" class="C" id="1981484">
        <attr name="foo" type="string" value="bar" />
      </attr>
      <attr name="d" type="dict" id="1917900">
        <entry>
          <key type="string" value="foo" />
          <val type="string" value="bar" />
        </entry>
      </attr>
      </PyObject>

  Another virtue of the [xml_pickle] approach that is implied in
  the example is that dictionary keys need not be strings, as
  they must be in XML-RPC '<struct>' elements.  However, Perl,
  PHP and most langauges are closer to the XML-RPC model in this.


Weaknesses of [xml_pickle]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Unfortunately, [xml_pickle] lacks some types that many
  programming languages have.  If our goal is not simply to save
  and restore -Python- objects, but to exchange objects across
  languages, [xml_pickle] is not currently quite adequate.  The
  issue of floats and integers is not really important in
  principle; but designing an "unpickler" for, say, Java would be
  made easier by having the XML parser be able to determine the
  type needed, rather than defer that until the format of the
  'value' attribute is analyzed.

  Of more serious concern for cross-language pickling are the
  '<boolean>' and '<dateTime.iso8601>' tags that XML-RPC has, but
  Python lacks as a built-in type.  Even though I claimed that
  [xml_pickle] handled user classes that define custom data
  types easily and well, that is not quite as true when it comes
  to the cross-language case.  For example, the below fragment of
  an [xml_pickle] representation describes an iso8601 Date/Time:

      #----- [xml_pickle] version of an iso8601 Date/Time -----#
      <attr name="dte" type="PyObject" class="DateTime" id="1984076">
        <attr name="value" type="string" value="20011122T17:28:55" />
      </attr>

  There are two issues that make it difficult to utilize this
  data in, say, Perl or REBOL or PHP.  One matter is
  the namespace the restored class.  In Python, the namespace of
  the restored 'xmlrpclib.DateTime' becomes, by default,
  'xml_pickle.DateTime' (but the namespaces can be manually
  manipulated prior to unpickling).  The way Python's
  instantiation and namespaces work, little rests on this
  fact--or at least not if our interest is in the instance
  attributes rather than its methods.  But various languages
  handle scoping matters in very different ways.

  More important, by far, is the fact that this custom class
  cannot be easily recognized as a native type in languages where
  it is one.  Perl and PHP do not have a native DateTime type
  anyway, so nothing is really lost as long as unpicklers in
  those languages restore the 'value' instance attribute.  But
  something like REBOL has many more native data types.  Not just
  dates, but also exotic types like email addresses and URLs.
  Those are lost in the [xml_pickle] process.  Of course, XML-RPC
  also loses those data types.  Either way, we are left with
  plain string type to represent something more specific (or
  '<base64>' in XML-RPC, which [xml_pickle] handles by escaping
  highbit values--e.g.  "\xff").


Conclusion: Where to Go From Here?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Neither XML-RPC nor [xml_pickle] are entirely satisfactory as
  means of representing the object instances of popular
  programming languages.  But both of them come pretty close.
  Let me some suggest some approaches to patching up the short
  gap between these protocols and a general object serialization
  format.

  "Fixing" [xml_pickle] is actually amazingly simple.  Just add
  more types to the format.  For example, since [xml_pickle] was
  first developed, the 'UnicodeType' has been added to Python.
  Adding complete support for it took exactly four lines of new
  code (although that was simplified slightly by the fact XML is
  natively Unicode).  Or again, at the requirement of users, the
  [numeric] module's 'ArrayType' was added with little more work.
  Even if a type is not present in Python, a custom class could
  be defined within [xml_pickle] to add the behavior of that
  type--e.g. maybe REBOL's "email address" type will be supported
  with a fragment like:

      <attr name="my_address" type="email" value="mertz@gnosis.cx" />

  Once unpickled, [xml_pickle] could either just treat "email" as
  a synonym for "string", or we could implement an 'EmailAddress'
  class with some useful behaviors.  One such behavior, if we
  took the latter route would be pickling into the above
  [xml_pickle] fragment.

  "Fixing" XML-RPC is more difficult.  It would be easy to
  suggest just adding a bunch of new data types.  And purely
  technically there would be no particular problem with this.
  But as a social matter, XML-RPC's success makes it difficult to
  introduce incompatible changes.  A hypothetical "data-enhanced"
  XML-RPC would not play nice with all the existing
  implementations and installations.  Actually, some implementors
  have felt sufficiently bothered by the lack of a "nil" type
  that they have added a non-standard (or at best semi-standard)
  type to correspond to Java 'null', Python 'None', Perl 'undef',
  SQL 'NONE' and the like.  But a bunch more types that only some
  programming languages use is not going to fly.

  One approach to enhancing XML-RPC as an object serializer is to
  coopt the '<struct>' element to do double-duty.  Everything
  that is incompletely typed by standard XML-RPC could be wrapped
  in a '<struct>' with single '<member>', where the '<name>'
  indicates the special type.  While existing XML-RPC libraries
  do not do this, the XML-RPC protocol and DTD are so simple that
  adding this behavior is fairly trivial (but requires modifying
  the libraries, not just wrapping them, in most cases).

  For example, XML-RPC cannot naively describe the difference
  between Python lists and tuples.  So the below fragment is
  incomplete as a description of a Python object:

      #------ XML-RPC fragment for EITHER list OR tuple -------#
      <array>
        <data>
          <value>
            <double>11.2</double>
          </value>
          <value>
            <string>spam</string>
          </value>
        </data>
      </array>

  One could substitue the following representation, which is
  valid XML-RPC, and a suitable implementation could restore to
  a specific Python object:

      #------------ XML-RPC fragment for a tuple --------------#
      <struct>
        <member>
          <name>NEWTYPE:tuple</name>
          <value>
            <array>
              <data>
                <value>
                  <double>11.2</double>
                </value>
                <value>
                  <string>spam</string>
                </value>
              </data>
            </array>
          </value>
        </member>
      </struct>

   Representing a true '<struct>' could happen two (or more)
   ways.  (1) every '<struct>' could be wrapped in another
   '<struct>' (maybe with the '<name>' "OLDTYPE:struct" or the
   like).  For Python, this is probably best anyway, since
   dictionaries and object instances are both "NEWTYPE"s.  (2)
   The namespace-like prefix "NEWTYPE:" could be reserved for
   this special usage (accidental collision seems unlikely).


Resources
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Userland's XML-RPC homepage is, naturally, the place to start
  investigating XML-RPC.  Many useful resources can be found
  there:

    http://xmlrpc.com/

  While at the XML-RPC homepage, it is particularly worthwhile to
  investigate the tutorials and articles they provide links for:

    http://www.xmlrpc.com/directory/1568/tutorialspress

  Kate Rhodes has written a nice comparison called "XML-RPC vs.
  SOAP."  In it, she points to a number of details that belie
  SOAP's description as a "lightweight" protocol:

    http://weblog.masukomi.org/writings/xml-rpc_vs_soap.htm

  Richard P. Gabriel's rather famous paper "Lisp:  Good News, Bad
  News, How to Win Big" can be found in full at the below URL.
  What everyone reads and refers to is the section called "The
  Rise of 'Worse is Better'":

    http://www.ai.mit.edu/docs/articles//good-news/good-news.html

  The O'Reilly title _Programming Web Services with XML-RPC_, by
  Simon St. Laurent, Joe Johnston & Edd Dumbill, is quite
  excellent.  It's spirit matches that of XML-RPC itself.
