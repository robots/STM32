The gnosis.xml.validity Library

    Most hitherto existing XML API's have enforced
    well-formedness at a programmatic level, but hardly any can
    guarantee validity.  This is a serious weakness in the whole
    field of XML processing. This installment discusses its
    author's [gnosis.xml.validity] library for enforcing validity
    in Python objects intended for XML serialization.


IMPLEMENTING CONSTRAINTS?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A tip I wrote previously for IBM developerWorks' XML Zone took
  a conceputal look at reconciling object-oriented programming
  techiques with XML validity contraints.  This installment of
  _XML Matters_ presents an early version of an actual Python
  module for doing it.  One could create an analogous capability
  in other programming languages, but Python provides
  particularly versatile reflection mechanisms, and allows clear
  expression of validity constraints.

  On the face of it, Python--with its extremely dynamic (albeit
  strict) typing--might seem like a strange choice for
  implementing what is, essentially, an elaborate type system.
  But any oddness one might perceive is superficial.  In fact,
  the type systems of languages like Java, C++, or C#, while
  static, are far too impoverished to offer much meaningful help
  to XML validity constraints.  A pure functional language like
  Haskell might offer type hierarchies, discriminated unions,
  quantification and existential types, and so on, but OOP
  languages typically lack these things.  In statically typed OOP
  languages, one would have to build just as much custom
  validation into a library as does the currently discussed
  Python library.

  The module [gnosis.xml.validity] can helpfully be contrasted
  with several other XML-related.  Two other libraries that have
  been incorporated into the author's [gnosis.xml] package,
  were discussed in earlier articles.  [gnosis.xml.pickle] is
  able to produce a specialized XML serialization of any Python
  object whatsoever.  As with Python's standard [pickle] and
  [cPickle] modules, this provides a way to save and restore
  objects.  [gnosis.xml.objectify] operates in a reverse
  direction: given an arbitrary XML document, we can generate a
  "Pythonic" object (with a slight loss of information about the
  original XML).

  Python standard library includes support for DOM and SAX
  processing of XML documents.  Widely used 3rd party Python
  packages extend the support to include XSLT processing.  DOM
  (specifically 'xml.dom.minidom') offers a rather heavy API for
  OOP-style manipulation of XML documents--with methods common
  across DOM implementation in many programming languages.  SAX
  treats an XML document as a series of parsing events, and
  basically allows a procedural programming style.  XSLT declares
  a set of rules for transforming an XML document into something
  else (such as a different XML document).

  All of these libraries are useful, but none of them prevent an
  application from modifying aN XML-representation object in ways
  that break the validity of the underlying XML.  For example,
  deleting, adding, or moving a DOM node can easily create a DOM
  hierarchy that cannot be dumped into valid XML document.

WHAT MAKES UP VALIDITY?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The basic idea of XML validity is to specify -what- can occur
  inside an element, how -often- it can occur, and what
  -alternatives- exist about what can occur.  As well, when
  multiple things can occur inside an element, the order of
  occurence can be specified (or left open, as needed).  DTD's
  differ somewhat from W3C XML Schemas in what they can express,
  but the jist is the same.  Let us look at a highly simplified
  hypothetical 'dissertation.dtd':

      #---- A "dissertation" DTD with all basic constraints ---#
      <!ELEMENT dissertation (dedication?, chapter+, appendix*)>
      <!ELEMENT dedication (#PCDATA)>
      <!ELEMENT chapter (title, paragraph+)>
      <!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
      <!ELEMENT paragraph (#PCDATA | figure | table)+>
      <!ELEMENT figure EMPTY>
      <!ELEMENT table EMPTY>
      <!ELEMENT appendix (#PCDATA)>

  In other words, a dissertation -may- contain -one- dedication,
  -must- contain (one or more) chapters, and -may- contain (zero
  or more) appendixes.  The various subelement occur in the
  listed order (if at all).  Some elements contain only character
  data.  In the case of the '<paragraph>' tag, it may contain
  -either- character data -or- a '<figure>' subelement -or- a
  '<table>' subelement, or any combination of each of them.
  Structures can nest, but every basic validity concept is in the
  example.

  What the [gnosis.xml.validity] module does is let you create,
  e.g., a 'disseration' Python object that can -only- represent a
  valid disseration.  Moreover, when transformed into XML--using
  the 'print' command or 'str()' function--the XML automatically
  matches the desired DTD.


VALIDITY IN ACTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The easiest way to understand what [gnosis.xml.validity] does
  is to see it used.  In attitude, [gnosis.xml.validity] owes a
  heritage to the [Spark] parser.  That is, "validity classes"
  are defined using Python reflection rather than traditional
  sequential programming.  The symmetry is interesting inasmuch
  as [Spark] and [gnosis.xml.validity] in a sense do exactly
  opposite things--the former assumes rule-based structure in
  external texts, the latter enforces it in internal objects.

  A validity class is based very closely on a corresponding DTD
  or XML Schema.  A class simply inherits from a relevant
  validity type, then specializes (if necessary) by adding a
  class attribute.  A convention is used that any class named
  with an initial underscore represents a structure that does not
  have a corresponding tag.  For example, a <paragraph> element
  in a disseration can contain a collection of PCDATA and <figure>
  and <table> elements.  The disjunction type that is assembled
  into a <paragraph> collection does not itself have an XML tag.
  Therefore, this disjuction type is named '_mixedpara' in the
  below example:

      #------------------- dissertation.py --------------------#
      from gnosis.xml.validity import *
      class appendix(PCDATA):   pass
      class table(EMPTY):       pass
      class figure(EMPTY):      pass
      class _mixedpara(Or):     _disjoins = (PCDATA, figure, table)
      class paragraph(Some):    _type = _mixedpara
      class title(PCDATA):      pass
      class _paras(Some):       _type = paragraph
      class chapter(Seq):       _order = (title, _paras)
      class dedication(PCDATA): pass
      class _apps(Any):         _type = appendix
      class _chaps(Some):       _type = chapter
      class _dedi(Maybe):       _type = dedication
      class dissertation(Seq):  _order = (_dedi, _chaps, _apps)

  As with a DTD, the top level of a particular object/XML
  document can be any tag whose rules are given.  'dissertation'
  happens to be the highest level available here, but one can
  create documents of lower types also.  Let us take a look:

      #--------- Creating a valid disseration chapter ---------#
      >>> from dissertation import chapter, title, _paras, paragraph, PCDATA
      >>> chap1 = chapter(( title(PCDATA('About Validity')),
      ...                   _paras([paragraph(PCDATA('It is a good thing'))])
      ...                ))
      >>> print chap1
      <chapter><title>About Validity</title>
      <paragraph>It is a good thing</paragraph>
      </chapter>

  A <chapter> is initialized with a tuple containing a <title>
  and a '_paras' list. A <title>, in turn is initialized with
  some 'PCDATA', which is itself initialized with a (Unicode)
  string.  Likewise, a '_paras' list contains some <paragraph>'s,
  which are themselves initialized with 'PCDATA'.  Once an
  appropriate object exists, it simply prints itself as valid
  XML.

  All of those nested initialization, although obeying the
  details of the specified DTD validity rules, are rather
  cumbersome to bother with.  Therefore [gnosis.xml.validity]
  allows a -much- friendlier style for initialization.  Whenever
  a particular type is required, the initializer for that type is
  transparently *lifted* into the type itself.  Moreover, when a
  "quantification" type would normally be initialized by a list
  of things of the right type, specifying just one thing *lifts*
  the thing into a length one list of the thing.  "Lifting" is
  recursive.  One note is that 'Seq' types that use
  lifting must use the factory function 'LiftSeq()', but other
  types can lift their own initialization arguments (the details
  have to do with "new-style" inheritance from immutable Python
  types).  This sounds complicated, but it is enormously obvious
  in practice:

      >>> from dissertation import LiftSeq
      >>> chap1 = LiftSeq(chapter,('About Validity','It is a good thing'))
      >>> print chap1
      <chapter><title>About Validity</title>
      <paragraph>It is a good thing</paragraph>
      </chapter>


VALIDITY ENFORCEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  So far, we have created some valid XML/objects.  But so what? We
  could have also just written the valid XML text by hand.  The
  value of [gnosis.xml.validity] comes when you want to modify an
  object in either valid or invalid ways.  For example, here is a
  valid modification:

      #---------- Adding a paragraph (valid operation) --------#
      >>> paras_ch1 = chap1[1]
      >>> paras_ch1 += [paragraph('OOP can enforce it')]
      >>> print chap1
      <chapter><title>About Validity</title>
      <paragraph>It is a good thing</paragraph>
      <paragraph>OOP can enforce it</paragraph>
      </chapter>

  What happens, to the contrary, when we try something that is
  not allowed?  For example, a dissertation can have at most one
  dedication (at least as we have specified the example):

      #----------- Creating an optional dedication ------------#
      >>> from dissertation import _dedi, dedication
      >>> Maybe_dedication = _dedi([])
      >>> print Maybe_dedication

      >>> Maybe_dedication.append(dedication("To Mom."))
      >>> print Maybe_dedication
      <dedication>To Mom.</dedication>

      >>> Maybe_dedication.append(dedication("Also to Dad."))
      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<pyshell#71>", line 1, in ?
          Maybe_dedication.append(dedication("Also to Dad."))
        File "validity.py", line 140, in append
          raise LengthError, self.length_message % self._tag
      LengthError: List <_dedi> must have length zero or one

  Likewise, one cannot include something of the wrong type, even
  if the length of a quantification would be OK:

      #-------- Attempting to add item of wrong type ----------#
      >>> from gnosis.xml.validity import ValidityError
      >>> try:
      ...     paras_ch1.append(dedication("To my advisor"))
      ... except ValidityError, x:
      ....    print x
      Items in _paras must be of type <class 'dissertation.paragraph'>
      (not <class 'dissertation.dedication'>)

  All the exceptions that might be raised by violating
  constraints are descended from 'ValidityError'.  Programming
  using the [gnosis.xml.validity] library will probably involve
  wrapping many operation in 'try/except' blocks; it should not
  be possible to create an invalid object by attempting a
  disallowed operation.


SOME WORDS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A first note is that [gnosis.xml.validity] is strictly for
  Python 2.2+.  Although it is possible to implement it in
  earlier Python versions, I felt this project makes a good
  testing ground for some newer Python features.  Specifically,
  the library takes advantage of the type/class unification, and
  new-style classes.  I have some ideas about doing some tricky
  stuff with metaclasses in future library versions, and I might
  even work in properties and slots.

  The design of [gnosis.xml.validity] relies heavily on Python's
  introspection/reflection capabilities.  Several abstract
  classes comprise the main functionality.  Each of these classes
  must have concrete children to actually -do- anything, although
  all the children need to implement is (at most) one class
  attribute each.  When an XML tag corresponds to a class, the
  tag name is taken directly from the class name. As noted
  earlier, if a class name begins with an underscore, it has no
  corresponding XML tag.  The basic rule here is that any
  "tagged" validity class serializes itself with surrounding
  open/close tags; a "tagless" class just serializes its raw
  content (which might, however, include items that themselves
  have tags).  A limitation this scheme imposes is that
  [gnosis.xml.validity] cannot work with DTD's specifying XML
  tags with lead underscores; this limitation -could- be removed
  in future versions, but probably will not unless users have a
  need for this.

  The base abstract classes consist of the following:

  *PCDATA*: This one may be used directly, and so is not really
  abstract.  An XML element that -contains- PCDATA should inherit
  from this, but need not provide any further specialization.
  But in an alternation list for the 'Or' type, one simply lists
  'PCDATA'.  This is very closely modelled on DTD syntax.  I
  recommend listing 'PCDATA' first in such a list (as DTD's
  require), but that is not currently mandatory.

  *EMPTY*: Also modelled on DTD syntax.  As with 'PCDATA', this
  class should be inherited from, but no further specialization
  is required.

  *Or*: A child of 'Or' must add a '_disjoins' tuple as a class
  attribute.  Normally, that one attribute will be the whole
  implementation.  Listed in the tuple should be other validity
  classes.  Conceptually, a disjunction should involve two or
  more things, but no error is currently raised if there are
  fewer disjoins.

  *Seq*: A child of 'Seq' must add an '_order' tuple as a class
  attribute.  Normally, that one attribute will be the whole
  implementation.  Listed in the tuple should be two or more
  other validity classes; as with 'Or' the tuple length is not
  currently checked.  In instantiating a 'Seq' child, it is
  usually safer to utilize the factory function 'ListSeq()'.

  *Quantification*: This abstract class is a special case, in a
  way.  The examples in this article have not used
  'Quantification', but have instead used (still abstract)
  children of it.  For example, this is the implementation of the
  class 'Some':

      #------- 'Quantification' abstract child 'Some' ---------#
      class Some(Quantification):
          length_message = "List <%s> must have length >= 1"
          min_length = 1
          max_length = maxint

  The classes 'Maybe' and 'Any' have similar implementation.
  These three 'Quantification' children cover all the
  quantification options for DTD's, but XML Schemas can allow
  others, e.g. 'Three_to_Seven', whose implementation is
  straightforward.  I realize that a pretty good 'length_message'
  could be generated from the other attributes, but I felt like
  the pluralization and phrasing of messages was better done by a
  programmer.

  A concrete descendent of 'Quantification' must add a '_type'
  class attribute, which points simply to another validity class.
  In principle, a concrete child could add its own 'min_length',
  'max_length' and 'length_message'--but using an intermediary
  feels like better design.


WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As of this writing [gnosis.xml.validity] is largely a
  proof-of-concept.  A few things are still missing.  The most
  glaring absence is the complete lack of facility for adding XML
  tag attributes--let alone enforcing their validity.  In
  structure, attributes look a lot like subelements--merely
  unordered ones--so similar enforcement mechanism can be
  added to later versions of [gnosis.xml.validity].  This
  addition is certainly the highest priority for a next feature.

  There are some other conveniences would be nice to have in
  [gnosis.xml.validity].  It would be nice to generate a set of
  Python validity classes automatically from a DTD or XML Schema.
  Unlike in a DTD, however, a set of Python validity classes need
  to be defined in a particular order--or at least in an order
  that defines each class earlier than it is named in an
  attribute of another class.

  Reading from an existing, and valid, XML document would often
  be useful.  It is not necessarily obvious what the best way to
  achieve this is.  Since member items need to be valid object
  prior to their inclusion in larger structures, the simplest
  recursive descent approach would not work.  But it should be
  possible to deserialize an XML document to corresponding
  validity classes.

  Finally, some sort of higher level interface to the presented
  validity classes might ease work with them.  The strategy used
  in the library now is to raise exceptions for every disallowed
  action; but there may be ways of wrapping this in more
  convenient API's.  Perhaps silent failure or flag return values
  would be useful, or maybe some other sort of fallback
  operations for error cases.  Deciding the right interfaces
  probably will require more experimentation by users (including
  myself).

  I welcome reader feedback about what direction later versions
  of [gnosis.xml.validity] should take.  I believe the initial
  functionality will already aid a variety of XML programming
  tasks, but given how little similar library development has
  been done elsewhere, my intuitions about what is most useful
  are still vague.
