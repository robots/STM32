On the Pythonic Treatment of XML Documents As Objects (II)

WHAT IS XML? WHAT IS PYTHON?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  XML is a simplified dialect of the Standard Generalized Markup
  Language (SGML).  Many readers will be most familiar with SGML
  via one particular document type, HTML.  XML documents are
  similar to HTML in being composed of text interspersed with and
  structured by markup tags in angle-brackets.  But XML
  encompasses many systems of tags that allow XML documents to be
  used for many purposes:  magazine articles and user
  documentation, files of structured data (like CSV or EDI
  files), messages for interprocess communication between
  programs, architectural diagrams (like CAD formats), and many
  other purposes.  A set of tags can be created to capture any
  sort of structured information one might want to represent,
  which is why XML is growing in popularity as a common standard
  for representing diverse information.

  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.


INTRODUCTION: THE PROJECT
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  _XML Matters #1_ introduced the author's project for
  creating more seamless and natural integration between XML and
  Python.  Modules and packages such as [xmllib], [xml.sax],
  [pyxie], and [xml.dom] provide ways of handling XML documents
  that are common in the XML community.  Tools such as these are
  extremely similar to corresponding modules and libraries for
  other programming languages.  In fact, the organization of many
  such modules is a direct result of standards created by
  (language-neutral) XML standards bodies.  Consequently, one
  thing all the abovementioned modules have in common is that
  they implement very XML-oriented ways of thinking about
  documents and objects; in many cases this conceptual framework
  feels like it is tacked on to Python, rather than an integral
  part of it.

  Using Python implementations of general XML protocols has many
  uses.  Standards like DOM are easily portable between
  programming languages; and programmers of one language can
  easily pick up and work with DOM-oriented code written in
  another language.  However, there are also times when a
  -Python- programmer prefers to code in ways that feel much more
  like "normal" Python.  The Project discussed in these columns
  is simply to provide a set of "Pythonic" modules for working
  with XML documents.

  As a result of those asymmetries that exist between XML and
  Python, the Project--at least initially--contains two separate
  modules: one for representing arbitrary Python objects in XML
  ([xml_pickle]); a second one ([xml_objectify]) for "native"
  representation of XML documents as Python objects.  This
  article will address the latter module.

    ---- SIDEBAR: ----------------------------------------------

    The XML-SIG distribution is changed fairly frequently while
    it is in beta versions.  The changes in turn are extremely
    likely to affect the functioning of [xml_objectify].
    Therefore, an XML-SIG version known to be compatible with
    [xml_objectify] may be found at:

      http://gnosis.cx/download/py_xml_04-21-00.exe
      http://gnosis.cx/download/py_xml_04-21-00.zip

    The first URL is the Windows self-installer, the latter is
    simply an archive of those files to be unpacked under
    $PYTHONPATH/xml.

    Whenever the XML-SIG distribution reaches a release version
    and/or when the XML package is a part of an official Python
    release, the current [xml_objectify] should be updated to
    work with the official release.  The most current
    [xml_objectify] should always be available at:

      http://gnosis.cx/download/xml_objectify.py

    ------------------------------------------------------------


JUMPING AHEAD: HOW TO USE [xml_objectify]
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  The usage of [xml_objectify] is extremely simple, and is well
  documented in module docstring comments.  Let us take a quick
  look:

      #------ Create a Python object from an XML document -----#
      from xml_objectify import XML_Objectify
      xml_obj = XML_Objectify('address.xml')
      py_obj = xml_obj.make_instance()

  There are two steps involved in creating a "native" Python
  object from a generic XML document (use [xml_pickle] for
  handling of special 'PyObjects.DTD' format documents).  First
  you want to create an intermediate DOM-like factory object.
  Second, you may generate (one or more) Python object instances
  from the 'XML_Objectify' instance.  There is no reason you
  could not do both steps on the same line, as:

      #-------- Inline creation of XML/Python object ----------#
      py_obj = XML_Objectify('address.xml').make_instance()

  Of course, in this latter case, the factory object does not
  stay around to produce more "native" objects, and
  correspondingly its '._dom' data member (which contains a full
  DOM instance) is cleared.

  For comparison, -creation- of a DOM object need be no more
  difficult in Python:

      #------ Create a DOM object from an XML document --------#
      from xml.dom.utils import FileReader
      dom_obj = FileReader().readXml(open('address.xml'))

  'FileReader().readXml()' requires an actual file object, while
  'XML_Objectify()' may accept either a file object or a plain
  filename, but in either case, the object creation is a two line
  action.

  The difference between using the [xml_objectify] module and the
  [xml.dom] package is in the type of object one winds up with.
  A Python DOM object *is* a genuine Python object, but its
  attributes and methods do not correspond to the data and
  structure of the original XML document in as straightforward a
  way as with the 'XML_Objectify' object.  For example, to access
  the same XML attribute in the sample document, you have a
  choice between:

      #---- [xml.dom] versus [xml_objectify] Python objects ---#
      print py_obj.person[1].address.city
      print dom_obj.get_childNodes()[1].get_childNodes()[3].\
            get_childNodes()[3].get_attributes()['city'].value
      print dom_obj._node.children[1].children[3].children[3].\
            attributes['city'].children[0].value

  The basic organization of a DOM tree is a strict ordered tree
  of nodes.  It is not hard to enumerate over these nodes, but it
  is quite cumbersome to refer to specific ones.  Making matters
  worse is that some nodes are whitespace text nodes and
  processing instruction nodes--which you rarely care about--and
  finding the subtags in the node list is mostly trial-and-error.
  In the above example both access to the "native" attributes
  (e.g. '.children') and the DOM-style methods (e.g.
  '.get_childNodes()') are used in different 'print' statements.
  Either way, it is not easy to see what datum in the XML
  document is being referenced.

  On the other hand, the first 'print' statement above pretty
  much documents itself.  Python's zero-based list indexing must
  be noted, as usual.  Beyond that minor caveat, the line just
  says: "Print the city of the address of the second person in
  the addressbook" ("New York" is what is printed by each
  statement).  To help you out further, 'py_obj.__class__' is
  "addressbook", corresponding to the root element of the XML
  document (and every attribute that might contain more than
  simple text is an instance of a class named according to the
  XML tag defining it).


DESIGN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  --WHY NOT JUST USE [xml.dom]?--
  [xml_objectify] makes wide use of DOM internally.  In fact,
  every 'XML_Objectify' instance contains a '._dom' attribute
  that is a DOM tree for the XML document opened (but the
  instance created by '.make_instance' does not contain any DOM,
  and is the class type of the root tag).  The problem with DOM
  is that it is just to hard to use, and the syntax is too
  obscure.  The above examples illustrate this.  Python "native"
  objects are much easier to program with.

  --INTROSPECTIVE EXPECTATIONS--
  With [xml_objectify], you can take advantage of all your
  existing generic functions.  The function 'pyobj_printer()'
  included in the module is a sample generic function.  This
  function produces a "pretty" recursive representation of
  -any- Python object.  By representing your XML documents as
  "native" Python documents, you can get a lot of reuse out of
  existing functions that deal with Python objects in abstract
  ways.  Of course, a DOM object still is a Python object of
  sorts, but as in the above usage example, its attributes are
  mostly a bunch of nested '.children' lists; and these are not
  all that helpful semantically (try printing a DOM object with
  the provided generic function).

  --TRICKS WITH CLASS BEHAVIOR--
  A subtle trick done by [xml_objectify] is that it will only
  dynamically define a class for an attribute value if that class
  has not already been defined.  What this accomplishes is that
  it lets you define classes with complex behavior and attributes
  in which to pour specific XML document contents.  For example,
  if the class 'person' is pre-defined with various methods
  (including an '.__init__()' method if needed), each "person" in
  the XML addressbook imported in the above sample code will have
  whatever behaviors it has been given, including methods that
  operate on the data poured into the instance.  Of course, if a
  class is not pre-defined prior to 'XML_Objectify()'ing a
  document, the class is just a container for the attributes
  defined in the actual XML.


LIMITATIONS AND SPECIAL BEHAVIORS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  --CHARACTER MARKUP--
  Some XML tags are block-level, but some are character-level.
  The most natural Python representation--at least to the
  author's mind--is different in the two cases.  Block-level tags
  are the norm; each block-level subtag is easily represented by
  an attribute of the parent tag that is named after the subtag,
  and the value of the subtag-attribute is a new Python object
  also of a type named after the subtag.  For example, a
  '<person>' might -have- an '<address>' and '<misc-info>'.  It
  is nice to Pythonically refer to these as 'person.address' and
  'person.misc_info'.

  However, when the -contents- of a tag are a mixture of some
  text data and some markup of that data (often typographic in
  nature), the subtags really are not something the parent tag
  -has-.  For example, a 'misc_info' object does not really
  -have- 'ital' attributes in the above hierarchical way.  So how
  should we represent some XML like?

      <misc-info>One of the <ital>most</ital> talented actresses on TV.</misc-info>

  The approach of [xml_objectify] is to add a special attribute
  called '._XML' to objects/tags that seem to contain marked-up
  character data.  This attribute contains the literal XML inside
  a tag, if the programmer wants it.  The 'pyobj_printer()'
  function, for example, will display this literal XML instead of
  recursive attributes if the '._XML' attribute exists for a
  given nested object.  However, the standard recursive
  subtag-object creation is still performed, so the programming
  requirement can look at whatever attributes and structures are
  most relevant.

  --NATIVE PYTHON OBJECTS CONTAIN ROOT DOCUMENT ONLY--
  Many XML documents contain processing instructions and/or
  comments in addition to their tags and character data contents.
  However, the Python "native" object created by the
  '.make_instance()' method of an 'XML_Objectify' object contains
  only the contents of the document root tag.  Furthermore, XML
  comments are ignored; only tag attributes and character data is
  represented.

  If you keep around the original 'XML_Objectify' object
  ('xml_obj' in the first example above), you can access its
  '.processing_instruction' attribute, or even its '._dom'
  attribute to look at what was left out of the "native" Python
  object.

  --ATTRIBUTE TYPE SIMPLIFICATION--
  All XML attributes are converted to Python object attributes of
  string type.  No effort is currently made to represent XML
  enumerated types, or even to represent numeric types for
  attributes.  Such capabilities might be added to later
  versions, but these would generally require the presence of a
  DTD, which [xml_objectify] does not assume.

  --SUBTAGS ATTRIBUTES ARE EITHER LISTS OR INSTANCES--
  XML subtags are represented by -either- Python attributes of
  object type -or- by lists of such objects (depending on whether
  there are one or several such subtags of the same type).  The
  decision whether to use a list of objects as an attribute value
  is decided simply by whether a -particular- tag contains
  multiple subtags of the same type.  For example, in the
  provided 'address.xml' sample, some person's contact-info
  includes one home-phone, some includes zero, and some includes
  several.  Corresponding to this, some 'contact_info' objects
  will have no '.home_phone' attribute at all, some will have a
  '.home_phone' attribute containing a 'home_phone' object, and
  some will have a '.home_phone' attribute containing a list of
  'home_phone' objects.  It would be possible to impose more
  order if a DTD was used, but the author believes this kind of
  dynamism is appropriate to most types of Python programming.

  --PYTHON NAMESPACE RESTRICTIONS--
  The Python namespace is smaller than the XML namespace.
  Therefore, sometimes XML names (of either tags or attributes)
  have to be modified.  The specific transformation made is
  changing dashes, colons, and the pound/hash mark, into
  underscores.  Further namespace collision is not avoided.  For
  example, if your XML document has tags, '<spam-eggs>',
  '<spam_eggs>', '<spam:eggs>' and <spam#eggs>, [xml_objectify]
  will create Python objects that do not correctly represent your
  XML document.  Or maybe the module will outright crash, or
  maybe it will break your data and fry your machine.  Probably
  not the latter problems, but the current version of
  [xml_objectify] simply does not take this namespace collision
  into account.  In real-life, it will rarely create any
  problems, since you probably do not have XML documents with
  those conflicting tags.

  --NO EXPORT BACK TO XML--
  Initially, the author considered including a capability for
  converting Python "native" objects back to XML documents with
  the same structure as those read-in.  That goal was not
  included in the current version because there are many
  implementation issues that are not easy to resolve.  Basically,
  [xml_objectify] deliberately throws out some information in XML
  documents in order to produce far friendlier Python objects.
  However, once information is gone, the best you can do is guess
  at what it was.  One principle type of information that is lost
  is about order.  Python attributes do not have any
  predetermined order among them, but XML tags and attributes
  might be required to occur in specific sequence.  Or even where
  XML tags are not -required- to occur in specific order, the
  order might be semantically important (in the case of repeated
  common subtags, Python lists maintain order).  In order to
  convert back to XML, we would either need to choose arbitrary
  orders, or somehow tuck away order information within the
  "native" Python object (which might make it feel less
  "native").

  One option that would make it possible to go much of the way
  towards reconstructing dropped information in the Python
  objects produced by '.make_instance()' would be to enforce a
  DTD in writing back to XML.  Even if this additional work was
  performed, questions would still exist about how to handle
  attributes added, deleted, or modified at Python runtime
  (modifying a Python object could produce something that was not
  conformant to the DTD of the original XML document).  However,
  any capability added will be added to later version of
  [xml_objectify] (and probably only if a specific need arises
  for users).
