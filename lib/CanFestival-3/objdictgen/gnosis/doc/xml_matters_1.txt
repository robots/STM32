WHAT IS XML? WHAT IS PYTHON?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  XML is a simplified dialect of the Standard Generalized Markup
  Language (SGML).  Many readers will be most familiar with SGML
  via one particular document type, HTML.  XML documents are
  similar to HTML in being composed of text interspersed with and
  structured by markup tags in angle-brackets.  But XML
  encompasses many systems of tags that allow XML documents to be
  used for many purposes:  magazine articles and user
  documentation, files of structured data (like CSV or EDI
  files), messages for interprocess communication between
  programs, architectural diagrams (like CAD formats), and many
  other purposes.  A set of tags can be created to capture any
  sort of structured information one might want to represent,
  which is why XML is growing in popularity as a common standard
  for representing diverse information.

  Python is a freely available, very-high-level, interpreted
  language developed by Guido van Rossum.  It combines a clear
  syntax with powerful (but optional) object-oriented semantics.
  Python is available for almost every computer platform you
  might find yourself working on, and has strong portability
  between platforms.


INTRODUCTION: THE PROJECT
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  There exist a number of techniques and tool for dealing with
  XML documents in Python.  The Resources section provides links
  to two developerWorks articles by this author that discuss
  general techniques, as well as links to other documents on
  XML/Python topics.  However, one thing that most existing
  XML/Python tools have in common is that they are much more
  XML-centric than Python-centric.  Certain constructs and
  coding techniques feel "natural" in a given programming
  language, and others feel much more like they are imported from
  other domains.  The latter type of construct can certainly get
  a job done--and in many cases a certain degree of stylistic
  clash between a programming tool and its problem domain is
  inevitable.  But in an ideal environment all constructs fit
  intuitively into their domain, and domains merge seamlessly.
  When it does, programmers can wax poetic rather than merely
  "make it work."

  This author has begun a research project of creating a more
  seamless and more natural integration between XML and Python.
  This article, and subsequent articles in this column, will
  discuss some of the goals, decisions, and limitations of this
  project; and hopefully along the way provide readers with a set
  of modules and techniques that are useful to them, and that
  point to easier ways to meet programming goals.  All tools
  created as part of the Project will be released to the public
  domain.

  Python is a language with a flexible object system and a rich
  set of built-in types.  The richness of Python is both an
  advantage and a disadvantage for the Project.  On the one hand,
  having a wide range of native facilities in Python makes it
  easier to represent a wide range of XML structures easily.  On
  the other hand, however, the range of native types and
  structures of Python makes for more cases to worry about in
  representing native Python objects in XML.  As a result of
  those asymmetries that exist between XML and Python, the
  Project--at least initially--contains two separate modules: one
  for representing arbitrary Python objects in XML
  ([xml_pickle]); a second one ([xml_objectify]) for "native"
  representation of XML documents as Python objects.  This
  article will address the former module.


PART I: [xml_pickle]
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Python's standard [pickle] module already provides a simple and
  convenient method of serializing Python objects, which is in
  turn useful for persistent storage or transmission over a
  network.  In some cases, however, it is desirable to perform
  serialization to a format with several properties not possessed
  by [pickle]:  (1) The format is human-readable; (2) The format
  may be parsed, manipulated, and objects imported, by languages
  other than Python; (3) The format supports validation of stored
  serialized objects.  [xml_pickle] provides each of these
  features, while maintaining interface compatibility with
  [pickle].  However, [xml_pickle] is not a general-purpose
  replacement for [pickle] since [pickle] retains several
  advantages of its own, such as faster operation (especially via
  [cPickle]) and far more compact object representation.

  This article discusses the design goals and decisions that went
  into [xml_pickle], as well as thoughts on the module's likely
  uses.


USING [xml_pickle]
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Even though the interface of [xml_pickle] is mostly the same as
  as that of [pickle], it is worth illustrating the (quite
  simple) usage of [xml_pickle] for readers who are not familiar
  with Python or with [pickle]:

      #------- Python code to demonstrate [xml_pickle] -------#
      import xml_pickle  # import the module

      # declare some classes to hold some attributes
      class MyClass1: pass
      class MyClass2: pass

      # create a class instance, and add some basic data members to it
      o = MyClass1()
      o.num = 37
      o.str = "Hello World"
      o.lst = [1, 3.5, 2, 4+7j]

      # create an instance of a different class, add some members
      o2 = MyClass2()
      o2.tup = ("x", "y", "z")
      o2.num = 2+2j
      o2.dct = { "this": "that", "spam": "eggs", 3.14: "about PI" }

      # add the second instance to the first instance container
      o.obj = o2

      # print an XML representation of the container instance
      xml_string = xml_pickle.XML_Pickler(o).dumps()
      print xml_string

  Everything except the first line and the next to last line is
  generic Python for working with object instances.  It might be a
  little contrived and a little simple, but essentially
  everything you do with instance data members is contained in
  the example (including nesting instances as container data,
  which is how most complex structures are built in Python).  All
  a Python programmer needs to do to encode her objects as XML is
  make one method call.

  Of course, once you have 'pickled' your objects, you will want
  to also restore them later (or elsewhere).  Supposing the above
  few lines have already run, restoring the object representation
  is as simple as:

      #-- Creating object from xml_pickle'd representation ---#
      new_object = xml_pickle.XML_Pickler().loads(xml_string)

  Obviously, in real cases you would want to do something more
  interesting with the created XML document than just hold it in
  memory during runtime.  For example, you might save the XML
  document to disk (maybe using the 'XML_Pickler.dump()' method),
  or transmit it over a communication channel.  Actually, the
  example *does* print to paper, which might well be a good
  durable storage format.


SAMPLE PYOBJECTS.DTD DOCUMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Running the sample code above will produce a pretty good
  example of the features of an [xml_pickle] representation of a
  Python object.  However, the below example is a hand-coded
  test case developed by the author.  The test case has the
  advantage of containing every XML structure, tag and attribute
  allowed in document type.  The specific data is invented, but
  it is not hard to imagine the application the data might belong
  to:

      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <!DOCTYPE PyObject SYSTEM "PyObjects.dtd">
      <PyObject class="Automobile">
         <attr name="doors" type="numeric" value="4" />
         <attr name="make" type="string" value="Honda" />
         <attr name="tow_hitch" type="None" />
         <attr name="prev_owners" type="tuple">
            <item type="string" value="Jane Smith" />
            <item type="tuple">
               <item type="string" value="John Doe" />
               <item type="string" value="Betty Doe" />
            </item>
            <item type="string" value="Charles Ng" />
         </attr>
         <attr name="repairs" type="list">
            <item type="string" value="June 1, 1999:  Fixed radiator" />
            <item type="PyObject" class="Swindle">
               <attr name="date" type="string" value="July 1, 1999" />
               <attr name="swindler" type="string" value="Ed's Auto" />
               <attr name="purport" type="string" value="Fix A/C" />
            </item>
         </attr>
         <attr name="options" type="dict">
            <entry>
               <key type="string" value="Cup Holders" />
               <val type="numeric" value="4" />
            </entry>
            <entry>
               <key type="string" value="Custom Wheels" />
               <val type="string" value="Chrome Spoked" />
            </entry>
         </attr>
         <attr name="engine" type="PyObject" class="Engine">
            <attr name="cylinders" type="numeric" value="4" />
            <attr name="manufacturer" type="string" value="Ford" />
         </attr>
      </PyObject>

  A formal document type definition (DTD) is currently being
  developed, and should be available in this article's source
  archive by the time the article first appears (check
  Resources).  Informally, it is not difficult to see the
  structure of a 'PyObjects.dtd' XML document.  But the DTD may
  disambiguate any issues the author has overlooked.

  Looking at the sample XML document, one can see that the three
  stated design goals of [xml_pickle] have been met: (1) The
  format is human readable; (2) The XML representations may be
  manipulate by means other than [xml_pickle], whether that is
  unrelated Python/XML modules, XML libraries in other
  programming languages, XML-enhanced editors and utilities, or
  just simply text-editors (as was used in creation of the
  sample); (3) XML representations of Python objects may be
  validated--at least this will be possible using standard XML
  validators once 'PyObjects.dtd' is completed and tested.  Once
  the DTD is in place, *all and only* DTD conformant documents
  will be representations of valid Python objects.


DESIGN FEATURES, CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  CONTENT MODEL.  The content model of Python and XML are in
  certain respects simply different.  One difference to pay heed
  to is that XML documents are inherently linear in form.  Python
  object attributes--and also Python dictionaries--have no
  definitional order (although implementation details create
  arbitrary ordering, such as of hashed keys).  In this respect,
  the Python object model is closer to the relational model:
  rows of a relational table have no "natural" sequence, and
  primary or secondary keys may or may not provide any meaningful
  ordering on a table (the keys are always orderable by
  comparison operators, but this order may be unrelated to the
  semantics of the keys).

  An XML document always lists its tag elements in a particular
  order.  The order may not be significant to a particular
  application, but being a linear document format the XML
  document order is always there.  The effect of the differing
  significance of key order in Python and XML is that the XML
  documents produced by [xml_pickle] are not guaranteed to
  maintain element order through pickle/unpickle cycles.  For
  example, a hand prepared PyObjects.dtd XML document like the
  above may be "unpickled" into a Python object.  If the
  resultant object is then "pickled" the <attr> tags will most
  likely occur in a different order than in the original
  document.  This is a feature, not a bug, but the fact should be
  understood.

  LIMITATIONS.  Several known limitations occur in [xml_pickle]
  as of the current version (0.2).  One potentially serious flaw
  is that no effort is made to trap cyclical references in
  compound/container objects.  If an object attribute refers back
  to the container object (or some recursive version of this),
  [xml_pickle] will exhaust the Python stack.  Cyclical
  references are likely to indicate a flaw in object design to
  start with, but later versions of [xml_pickle] will certainly
  attempt to deal with them more intelligently.

  Another limitation exists in that the namespace of XML
  attribute values (such as the "123" in <attr name="123">) is
  larger than the namespace of valid Python variables and
  instance members.  If attributes are (manually) created outside
  the Python namespace they will have the odd status of existing
  in an instance's '.__dict__' magic attribute, but being
  inaccessible by normal attribute syntax (e.g.  "obj.123" is a
  syntax error).  This is only an issue where XML documents are
  created or modified by means other than [xml_pickle] itself.
  The author simply has not decided what the best way of handling
  this (somewhat obscure) issue will be.

  Not all attributes of Python objects are handled by
  [xml_pickle] either.  All the "usual" data members (strings,
  numbers, dictionaries, etc.) are pickled well.  But instance
  methods, and class and function objects as attributes, are not
  handled.  Methods are simply ignored in pickling (as with
  [pickle]).  If class or function objects exist as attributes,
  an XMLPicklingError is raised.  This is probably the correct
  ultimate behavior, but a final decision has not been made yet.

  DESIGN CHOICES.  One genuine ambiguity in XML document design
  is the choice of when to use tag attributes, and when to use
  sub-elements.  Opinions on this design issue differ, and XML
  programmers often feel strongly about their conflicting views.
  This was probably the biggest issue in deciding the
  [xml_pickle] document structure.

  The general principle decided on was that a *thing* that is
  naturally "plural" should be represented by sub-elements.  For
  example, a Python list can contain as many items as you like,
  and is therefore represented by a sequence of <item>
  sub-elements.  On the other side, a number is a singular thing
  (the value might be more than 1, but there is only one *thing*
  in it).  In that case it seemed much more logical to use an XML
  attribute called "value".  The real difficult case was with
  Python strings.  In a basic way, they are *sequence*
  objects--just like lists.  But representing each character in a
  string using a hypothetical <char> tag would destroy the goal
  of human-readability, as well as make for enormous XML
  representations.  The decision was made to put strings in the
  XML "value" attribute, just as with numbers.  However, from an
  aesthetic point-of-view this is probably less desirable than
  within a tag container, especially for multi-line strings.
  But this decision seemed more consistent since there was no
  other "naked" #PCDATA in the specification.

  In part because strings are stored in XML "value"
  attributes--but mostly to maintain the syntacticality of the
  XML document, Python strings needed to be stored in a "safe"
  form.  There are a few unsafe things that could occur in Python
  strings.  The first type is the basic markup characters like
  greater-than and less-than.  A second type is the quote and
  apostrophe characters that set off attributes.  The third type
  is questionable ASCII values, such as a null character.  One
  possibility considered was to encode the whole Python strings
  in something like base64 encoding.  This would make strings
  "safe," but also completely unreadable to humans.  The decision
  was made to use a mixed approach.  The basic XML characters are
  escaped in the style of "&amp;", "&gt;" or "&quot;".
  Questionable ASCII values are escaped in Python-style, such as
  "\000".  The combination makes for easily human-readable XML
  representations, but requires a somewhat mixed approach to
  decoding stored strings.


ANTICIPATED USES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are a number of things that [xml_pickle] is likely to be
  good for, and some user-feedback has indicated that it has
  entered preliminary usage.  Below are a few ideas.

    - XML representations of Python objects may be indexed and
      cataloged using existing XML-centric tools (not necessarily
      written in Python).  This provides a ready means of
      indexing Python object databases (such as ZODB, PAOS, or
      simply [shelve]).

    - XML representations of Python objects could be restored as
      objects of *other* OOP languages, especially ones having
      a similar range of basic types.  This is something yet to
      do.  Much "heavier" protocols like CORBA, XML-RPC, and
      SOAP have overlapping purpose, but [xml_pickle] is pretty
      "light-weight" as an object transport specification.

    - Tools for printing and displaying XML documents can be used
      to provide convenient human-readable representations of
      Python objects via their XML intermediate form.

    - It is possible to manually "debug" Python objects via their
      XML representation using XML specific editors, or simply
      text editors.  Once hand-modified objects are unpickled,
      the effects of the edits on program operation can be
      examined.  Other debuggers and wrappers exist for Python,
      but this provides an additional option.

  If readers develop additional uses for [xml_pickle] or see
  enhancements that would open the module to additional uses, the
  author would very much like to receive suggestions.
