    This tip points to some techniques programmers in object
    oriented languages can use to programmatically ensure the
    validity of XML documents at the time of their creation.


INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  XML has something of a dual identity.  On the one hand, in its
  SGML roots, XML is a way of expressing formally and rigidly
  structured data--DTD's and XML Schemas describe said
  structures.  On the other hand, as seen by popular APIs--DOM,
  SAX and XSLT, but also by other XML libraries--XML is merely a
  way of indicating generically hierarchical data. Unfortunately,
  the two sides communicate poorly.  The *creation* of valid
  documents falls outside these APIs (validation is usually
  ghettoized to the parse phase).  However, by using just a few
  special strategies one can convince OOP objects to look at
  least a lot like valid XML.


WHAT MAKES UP VALIDITY?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The sorts of validity constraints one can express with a DTD
  differ somewhat from those one can express with a W3C XML
  Schema.  For this tip, I will focus on issues common to the
  different validity constraint specification styles.

  The basic idea of XML validity is to specify -what- can occur
  inside an element, how -often- it can occur, and what
  -alternatives- exist about what can occur.  As well, when
  multiple things can occur inside an element, the order of
  occurence can be specified (or left open, as needed).  Let us
  look at a highly simplified hypothetical 'dissertation.dtd':

      #---- A "dissertation" DTD with all basic constraints ---#
      <!ELEMENT dissertation (dedication?, chapter+, appendix*)>
      <!ELEMENT dedication (#PCDATA)>
      <!ELEMENT chapter (title, paragraph+)>
      <!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
      <!ELEMENT paragraph (#PCDATA | figure | table)>
      <!ELEMENT figure EMPTY>
      <!ELEMENT table EMPTY>
      <!ELEMENT appendix (#PCDATA)>

  In other words, a dissertation -may- contain -one- dedication,
  -must- contain (one or more) chapters, and -may- contain (zero
  or more) appendixes.  The various subelement occur in the
  listed order (if at all).  Some elements contain only character
  data.  In the case of the '<paragraph>' tag, it may contain
  -either- character data -or- a '<figure>' subelement -or- a
  '<table>' subelement.  Structures can nest, but every basic
  validity concept is in the example.


MAKING AN OBJECT LOOK LIKE A DOCUMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Although DOM does not do so, OOP languages have all the basic
  data structures to represent validity (some languages more
  completely than others).  The trick, basically, is to create
  objects whose attributes are constrained so as to only allow
  the allowable things into them.  Whether this is done at
  compile time or runtime depends on the language used, but
  either approach can introduce needed constraints.  In any case,
  creating the right sorts of objects is something to do for each
  document type, not generically for all of XML.

  XML documents are hierarchical, and objects that can contain
  other objects as attributes are likewise hierarchical.  At a
  first brush, this general hierarchy gives us a homomorphism.
  We just need to pick a few object types for the various
  attributes.

  At a document root--and at other levels underneath it--we want
  to specify the specific children that can occur, and their
  order.  Two approaches come to mind.  One option is to create a
  heterogeneous sequence of the things that occur in the element.
  Haskell and Python tuples have the nice quality of being
  immutable (as are, e.g., Fortran records), but a regular list
  or array (e.g. of void pointers) can serve also.  For example,
  in Ruby we might "declare":

      #----- Init'ing Ruby "Root" class with member "part" ----#
      dissertation = Root.new [ Maybe_dedication.new, \
                                Some_chapter.new, \
                                Any_appendix.new ]
      # Example of accessing part of root element sequence
      dissertation.part[1].addchapter(some, arguments, here)

  The example leaves open exactly what the classes
  'Maybe_dedication', 'Some_chapter' and 'Any_appendix' do, but
  contains the sequence idea.  'dissertation' is an instance of
  the class 'Root', whose job it is to hold a sequence (and
  probably has a few other methods, like writing the XML or
  validating the current instance).

  A second approach that is easier in many languages is to make
  the things occur as the root attributes directly, but reserve a
  special attribute that indicates the sequence.  For example,
  Java might do something like:

      #--- Java class to hold dissertation parts as members ---#
      public class dissertation {
          Maybe dedication = new Maybe(dedication_type);
          Some chapter = new Some(chapter_type);
          Any appendix = new Any(appendix_type);
          Seq _seq = new Seq[] {dedication, chapter, appendix};
      }
      /* Access is somewhat more natural now */
      dissertation.chapter.add(some, arguments, here);


EXPRESSING QUANTIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We have seen that the "parts" of elements can be allowed to
  occur in various number: one or zero; one or more; zero or
  more.  We need objects to represent these quantities.  The
  "possibility" case (zero or more) is straightforwardly
  represented by standard (homogeneous) sequences--lists, arrays,
  vectors, or whatever the langauges calls them and provides.  In
  order to provide other behaviors, it is probably worth wrapping
  a basic sequence in a custom class.

  The "limitation" case (one or zero, i.e. not more than one) has
  less of an obvious structure.  Most likely a 'Maybe' class (and
  descendents like 'Maybe_dedication') should be built around a
  basic sequence object, with guards against adding more than one
  thing in the provided methods.  This is similar to our example
  for the "existential" case (one or more).  So let us look at a
  possible (incomplete) Python implementation:

      #------ Python class to hold "one or more" things -------#
      class ExistentialList(UserList.UserList):
          def __init__(self, tag=None, initlist=[]):
              if tag is None:
                  raise ValueError, "Must specify tag name"
              self.tag = tag
              UserList.__init__(self, initlist)
          def __delitem__(self, i):
              del self.data[i]
              self.validate()
          def __repr__(self):
              self.validate()
              return '\n'.join(['<%s>%s</%s>' % (self.tag, item, self.tag)
                                for item in self.data])
          def validate(self):
              if not len(initlist):
                  raise "ExistentialError", "List must have length >= 1"

  A more robust example might add features like checks for proper
  item types in the '.append()', '.extend()', '.__setitem__()'
  and other methods that can add to the list.  A language with
  static typing would simply declare the type of things in the
  list, but would use a similar validation of size.  In C++, one
  might use templates and generic programming to implement the
  general features of an' ExistentialList', but specialize to
  subelement type.

  An important feature for every object that represents a
  subelement is the ability to serialize itself to XML.  Python
  reserves a "magic" method called '__repr__()'; other language
  might use a method called '.write()' or '.toXML()'.  The
  serialization also needs recursively to descend into children,
  which is handled "automatically" by Python with the magic
  method.  In other cases, some manual calls on attribute objects
  will be needed.


EXPRESSING DISJUNCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Alternation between occurrence patterns is more difficult to
  express in most OOP languages.  There are a few languages--like
  Pascal, Fortran, and most elegantly Haskell--that allow
  enumerated types (discriminated union), but these are the
  exception, not the rule.  In most languages, one just has to
  add custom checking to make sure one of the allowable things is
  contained by an instance.

  One might program polymorphic constructor functions, perhaps by
  providing multiple type signatures to the constructors.  Each
  allowable thing in an alternation pattern would have a
  constructor (including, possibly, sequence types where
  quantifiers are used with the disjoins).

  However, a more flexible approach is to use a generic framework
  that receives its alternation list either via initialization
  arguments, or by inheritence from an "Or" superclass.  Such a
  child might look like:

      #----- Python specialization of "Or" abstract class -----#
      class paragraph(Or):
          disjoins = (PCDATA, figure, table)

  Assuming the base functionality of the abstract class "Or"
  knows to look for a 'disjoins' class member, this could be
  sufficient specialization.  Naturaly, guarded setters and
  getters need be defined in the parent (in the Python case,
  probably with magic methods).


CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Using data classes with some constraints on the values
  contained therein allows us to mirror the validity requirements
  of XML documents.  Containment of classes can be structured in
  the same manner containment of subelements.  With a good
  framework of base classes in place, one can basicaly directly
  copy a DTD into a set of class definitions or initializations.
  Instances becomes members of other instances, and eventually
  one winds up with a "root" object instance whose self and
  attributes have various methods for manipulating data in ways
  that cannot break the validity requirements (in contrast to how
  easily one can break validity with basic types like strings and
  arrays). At the end of the manipulation, the root object should
  have some method to write out the XML--recursively descending
  into its attribute instances--which produces a fully grown
  valid XML document.  An 'ExistentialList', for example, can
  contain other 'ExistentialList' objects, nested serialization
  (the 'print' statement) works beautifully with the given
  sample.


RESOURCES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Everything one really -needs- to know about XML is in the
  Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 W3C Recommendation.  Of
  course understanding exactly what this signifies requires some
  subtlety:
