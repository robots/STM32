0.10  Initial version

0.22  Compatible with PyXML 0.52

0.30  Compatible with PyXML 0.61+

0.40  Joshua Macy added several worthwhile things.  This
      version is compatibility with Python 2.1 (and 2.0),
      assuming nothing changes between the beta and release.

      More importantly, Joshua added checks for cyclical
      references and for multiple bindings of identical
      objects.  Previously, xml_pickle effectively forced a
      deep copy; for example:

       obj.a = aDict
       obj.b = aDict
       obj.b is obj.a   # True
       ... pickle then restore ...
       obj.a is obj.b   # False

      With version 0.40, object identity is preserved across
      pickling.

0.45  Finally added Curtis Jensen's enhancements to use NumPy
      array type.

0.46  Joe Kraska pointed out referential inconsistencies in
      cyclical references, and provided changes (OK'd by Joshua
      Macy, who did the referential code to start with).

0.47  Improvement of the '_tag_completer()' flow control in
      case of referential objects (consistent fall- through to
      single 'return' statement.

0.48  Modified string concatenation strategy to more
      efficiently emit large XML documents (i.e. orders of
      magnitude better; specifically, O(n) rather than O(n^2))

0.49  Chip Salzenberg corrected a sloppy typo in the code for
      outputting Unicode strings.

0.50  Francesc Alted noticed a problem with pickling
      [xml_objectify] objects.  A narrow solution to the
      problem is to a avoid pickling the special '.__parent__'
      attribute that the EXPAT option in 'XML_Objectify()'
      uses.  A better solution to the broader issue of upward
      cyclical reference might be provided later.

0.51  Frank McIngvale contributed the addition of mxDateTime
      to pickleable types

0.60  Frank McIngvale added a large number of improvements and
      extensions to the system (with a bit of advice and help
      from David Mertz along the way):

      - Simplified minidom.parse call (dqm)

      - Pickle compiled SREs.

      - Before bailing out on unknown objects, try saving them
        in their pickled form (type="rawpickle").

      - All types can read/store their value either in the
        element body or the tag.

      - Changes for Python 2.2 compatibility:
            dir() changed
            node.attributes[tuple] stopped working
            more portable test for SRE type

      - Added a generalized extension system (non-builtins
        moved to xml_pickle_ext, except for NumPy, since it
        acts as a builtin).  Made mxDateTime format better,
        since code is out-of-line now (doesn't have to be so
        clever).

      - Refactored XML_Pickle to eliminate recursion problem,
        and removed unneeded PyObject template class.

      - Added XML_Pickle().dumps(object) form, and
        pickle-compatible inline dump(),dumps(),load(),loads()
        forms (added __all__ so these aren't auto-imported).

      - XML_Pickle is now more flexible about how it loads
        classes, and can restore full class functionality (just
        like pickle does).  However, as this could present
        security concerns, the PARANOIA setting was created -
        see docs.

      - Full __getstate__()/__setstate__() support, as well as
        __getinitargs__ (i.e. we're now compatible with the
        regular pickle protocol).

      - Handle all types as key/val/items, and fixed ref
        handling of key/val/items.  Catch unknown types in both
        elif blocks.

      - Fixed visited{} handling to properly keep temporary
        object from being reused.

      - Added DEEPCOPY to provide pre-0.40 behavior if desired.

      - Implemented dqm's suggestion that ref's keep the
        referenced typename, for better readibility and to make
        it easier for external tools to parse the XML
        (unfortunately, xml_pickle <= 0.51 won't be able to
        read these pickles -- we can still read old pickles,
        though).

0.70  Module refactored into a package.  Should make maintenance
      and further improvements easier.  Much extra
      documentation and test cases now included with package.

0.71  Various additional tweaking of the refactoring.
      Rearrangement of doc/ subpackage, and minor code cleanup
      throughout.

0.72  Added compressed-binary option to XML_Pickle.dump() and
      XML_Pickle.dumps(), and automatic recognition of compressed
      pickles.  Usage matches "binary" option of cPickle.

0.73  Some more bits from Frank McIngvale (frankm@hiwaay.net):

      - Split DOM parser off from _pickle.py and created
        parsers/ subdirectory. Added get/set parser functions.

      - Added SAX parser.

      - Replaced helpers with much superior mutator mechanism.
        Objects can now be decomposed (mutated) into any builtin
        type for pickling, instead of just a string.

      - Fixed Numeric handling so array.arrays and Numeric.arrays
        can both be pickled/unpickled in the same file.
        Moved Numeric and array out of "core" code and into a
        mutator extension.

      - Added setInBody() so user can customize placement of
        element text.

      - (With dqm) Added StreamWriter/StreamReader to genericize
        handling of compressed, etc., streams.

      - (With dqm) Added pickling of toplevel objects (handled
        as a mutated type).

      - More bits moved to util.py to aid reuse in parsers.

      - Fixed handling of self-referencing objects.

      - Handle FunctionType, BuiltinFunctionType, and ClassType

      - New tests; improved test harness.

      - Minimized "mini" inspect module.

      - setVerbose() to control verbosity of XML stream

MM/YY = Revision dates, from here on

05/02: Changes by dqm & fpm:

      - Version numbering now only for 'gnosis' package as a whole.
        This HISTORY will simply use approximate dates of
        changes.

      - Handle objects derived from builtins (Python >= 2.2)

      - Handle __slots__, as a superset of the cPickle behavior
        (we don't require __getstate__ - note that this
        implementation is somewhat experimental and may change if
        Python's handling of __slots__ changes).  On the other
        hand, new-style classes with slots cannot pass through
        cPickle's dump/load cycle; they do fine with xml_pickle.

      - Better (correct) handling of unicode vs. "regular"
        (Python) strings

      - Portability fixes in the test cases

05/02: A few small fixes/improvements since 1.0:

      - No longer calling eval() (dqm added gnosis.util.XtoY with
        safe alternative aton())

      - Sped up mutator switch with try_mutate()

      - No longer wrapping numerics with safe_content()

      - Sped up handling of object subclassed from builtins by
        caching hasCoreData() results

      - Small improvements to tests

      - Fixed PARANOIA == 0 to (hopefully) match how regular pickle
        dynamically creates classes (previously failed on threaded
        apps)

      - No longer using repr() for numerics; we now control the
        formatting explicitly

06/02 - Fixed bug in XtoY.aton() when parsing "0"

06/03 - Added support for bools in Python 2.3. Allow Python < 2.3
        to read these bools in backward compatible way.

      - Changed functions/classes from family 'uniq' to 'lang'.
        Added comments to explain family types for reference.

08/03 - Update to PyObject.dtd

02/04 - Corrections to floating point handling
