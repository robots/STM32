THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The transition from the 1.0.x series of Gnosis Utilities to the 1.1.x
series saw significant improvements to gnosis.xml.objectify.  See
HISTORY and HOWTO for details; but in short, we now maintain all the
structural information about nested children and mixed content.

However, the improvements in 1.1.x introduce some incompatibilities in
edge cases.

 1. In 1.0.x, only nodes with PCDATA content have a .PCDATA attribute.
    This is changed in 1.1.x so that all nodes have the attribute, but
    it is either None or an empty string if there is no textual content.

    If you had code that was something like:

      if hasattr(o,'PCDATA'): #...do something...

    You should instead use:

      if o.PCDATA: #...do something...

    Or if you want to be more explicit, you could check:

      if o.PCDATA is not None: #...do something...

    There is a subtle bit of extra semantic information in there.  If a
    node contains no content AT ALL, its .PCDATA attribute is None.  But
    if the node contains children, its .PCDATA is an empty string.  You
    can still do a boolean test on o.PCDATA either way, but you can also
    distinguish these cases if you wish, e.g.:

      >>> from gnosis.xml.objectify import make_instance
      >>> xml = '<foo><bar><baz/></bar><bar/></foo>'
      >>> o = make_instance(xml)
      >>> o.PCDATA, o.bar[0].PCDATA, o.bar[1].PCDATA, o.bar[0].baz.PCDATA
      ('', '', None, None)

    If you must maintain compatibility with both 1.0.x and 1.1.x
    versions of the library, you may use:

      if hasattr(o,'PCDATA') and o.PCDATA: #...do something...

 2. In 1.0.x, the .PCDATA attribute kinda-sorta normalized whitespace,
    rather than preserving it exactly.  But the normalization was
    erratic, for example treating CDATA sections differently than
    regular content.

    Now you have the option of either a completely normalized content
    using o.PCDATA, or a completely whitespace-preserving content
    using the dumps() convenience function

      >>> xml = """<foo>
      ...     <bar><![CDATA[
      ...             First Line
      ...                     Second Line [indented]
      ...             Third Line
      ...     ]]></bar>
      ... </foo>"""
      >>> o = make_instance(xml)
      >>> from gnosis.xml.objectify import dumps
      >>> print o.bar.PCDATA
      First Line Second Line [indented] Third Line
      >>> print dumps(o.bar)

                  First Line
                          Second Line [indented]
                  Third Line

      >>>

 3. You probably never should have relied on the ._root attribute used
    by the DOM parser.  But now that EXPAT is the default parser, you
    definitely should not count on it.

    There is now, in 1.1.x, a convenience function called tagname():

      >>> from gnosis.xml.objectify import tagname
      >>> o
      <foo id="239ecc">
      >>> tagname(o)
      'foo'

    This is a good way to find the root element, as well as to get the
    plain name of any node (rather than see the mangled name, like
    'gnosis.xml.objecitfy._XO_foo').

 4. Call gnosis.xml.objectify.config_nspace_sep() to enable namespaced
    XML document processing.  Maybe that should be the default, but
    I think there's a slight speed gain to the way it is.
