0.1    Initial version

0.11   Minor tweaks, and improvements to pyobj_printer().
       Added 'keep_containers()' function.

0.2    Grant Munsey pointed out my gaff in allowing ad-hoc
       contained instances (subtags) to collide with Python
       names already in use.  Fixed by name-mangling ad-hoc
       classes to form "_XO_klass" corresponding with tag
       <klass>.  Attributes still use actual tag name, e.g.,

         >>> py_obj.klass
         <xml_objectify._XO_klass instance at 165a50>

0.21   Costas Malamas pointed out that creating a template
       class does not actually *work* to create class
       behaviors.  It is necessary to get this class into the
       xml_objectify namespace.  Generally, this will involve
       an assignment similar to:

         xml_objectify._XO_Eggs = otherscope.Eggs

       A simple example can be found at:

         http://gnosis.cx/download/xo_test.py

0.30   Costas Malamas proposed the useful improvement of
       defining __getitem__ behavior for dynamically created
       child instances.  As a result, you can use constructs
       like:

         for myegg in spam.egg:
             print pyobj_printer(myegg)

       without needing to worry whether spam.egg is a list of
       instances or a single instance.

0.40   Altered by Kapil Thangavelu to work with the latest
       version of PyXML 0.61.  Mainly syntax changes to
       reflect PyXML's move to 4DOM.

0.45   Mario Ruggier goaded me to make xml_objectify compatible
       with Python 2.0 (his intent is presumably described
       differently :-) ).  Always optimistic, I (dqm) hope this
       will continue working with later PyXML and Python
       versions.

0.50   Costas Malamas provided a far faster expat-based parser
       to replace the DOM-based 'pyobj_from_dom()' technique
       (orders of magnitude, with a better complexity order).
       However, when using 'ExpatFactory' to produce a
       'py_obj', there no longer remains a 'xml_obj._dom'
       attribute to refer to for element-sequence or other
       DOM information.  As well, 'ExpatFactory' does not
       collect the 'py_obj._XML' attribute that character-
       oriented markup might want preserved.

       Use of the new parser simply requires an extra (named)
       argument at 'XML_Objectify' initialization, e.g.:

         xml_obj = XML_Objectify('spam.xml',EXPAT)   # or
         xml_obj = XML_Objectify('spam.xml',DOM)     # or
         xml_obj = XML_Objectify('spam.xml',parser=EXPAT)

       Conceivably, other parsers could be added in the
       future (but probably not).  The default option is
       the backward-compatible 'DOM'.

0.51   Minor cleanup of 0.50 changes.  Also, gave
       'keep_containers()' three states, rather than just
       two:

         NEVER:  do not store the _XML attribute
         MAYBE:  store _XML if there is char-level markup
         ALWAYS: keep _XML attribute for every element

0.52   Niggly bug fixes (mostly to Unicode handling, and a few
       Python 2.0+ enhancements).  Definitely requires Python
       2.0 now.

       Looking through old notes, I remembered Costas Malamas'
       suggestion for an _XO_.__len__() magic method.  This
       enables calls like:

         poached_eggs = map(poach, spam.egg)
         raw_eggs = filter(isRaw, spam.egg)

       whether spam.egg is an object or a list of objects.
       See 0.30 history for comparison.

0.53   Attribute name mangling modified slightly.  Dash in XML
       tag name now becomes double-underscore as a py_obj
       attribute name (important for [xml2sql]).

0.54   Added function '_dir()' for legacy behavior of builtin
       'dir()' under both Python 2.2 and earlier versions

0.60   Module refactored into gnosis.xml package (along with
       [xml_pickle].  This is a first pass, and various
       documentation and test cases should be added later.

0.61   Additional name mangling fixes at the suggestion of
       Bruno Lienard and Frank McIngvale.  Also changed all
       [string] functions to the string methods (since we
       already require 2.0+).

0.62   At the suggestion of Arnold Weis, XML_Objectify sources
       were made a bit more flexible, and now include any
       "file-like" objects (i.e. cStringIO, urllib, etc).

mm/yy: --------- Revisions by date -----------------------------

06/02: Greg Aumann added caching of dynamic class creation,
       for a significant speed increase.

       Reorganized xml_objectify into subpackage directories to
       fit better with the Gnosis_Utils structure.  Should not
       affect import line for anyone already using the gnosis.xml
       package.

       Version numbering now only for 'gnosis' package as a
       whole.  This HISTORY will simply use approximate dates of
       changes.

07/02: Rene Jager added the option to work directly with an
       existing DOM tree.  This is helpful in contexts--
       especially in Jython--where a DOM is already built for
       you.  Usage is:

         xml_object = XML_Objectify(dom)

08/02: Bob Gibson and Ville Vainio observed that in adding
       objectification of DOM trees, I failed to rename a
       variable used in objectifying files.  Fixed that.

05/03: At Rene Jagar's request XML_Objectify grew the class
       attributes expat_args, expat_kwargs to configure the EXPAT
       parser.  This is needed to handle namespaces in XML
       documents (see test cases).

06/03: Additional check for passed DOM node (has either
       childNodes or documentElement), suggested by W.McVey.

       Added heuristic to let users pass in XML(-ish) string at
       initialization.

07/03: Added _XO_.__repr__ method to make nodes print in a
       nicer, more compact fashion.

       Added ._seq attribute to node objects to support structure
       preserving convenience functions.  Specifically, older
       versions of gnosis.xml.objectify lost information about
       mixed content and the order of children.  E.g.,

         >>> xml = '<foo>Mixed <i>content</i> is <b>good</b></foo>'
         >>> obj = XO(xml,EXPAT).make_instance()
         >>> obj.PCDATA, obj.i.PCDATA, obj.b.PCDATA
         (u'Mixed is', u'content', u'good')

       We had no way of knowing where inside <foo> the <i> and
       the <b> occur, nor even which child element occurs first.

       Now we can recover that information:

         >>> from gnosis.xml.objectify import content, children
         >>> content(obj)
         [u'Mixed ', <i id="30264c">, u' is ', <b id="30292c">]
         >>> children(obj)
         [<i id="30264c">, <b id="30292c">]

       Sequence information and convenience methods are NOT
       SUPPORTED (yet?) for the DOM parser, only for EXPAT!

       Changed default parser to EXPAT.  If you have relied on
       the special attribute ._XML that the DOM parser attaches
       to nodes, you will now need to explicitly specify DOM as
       the parser used.  However, the new sequence functions
       pretty well handle the job pyobj._XML used to do (in a
       different way).

02/04: Frank von Delft addressed a Geometric slowdown in
       _objectify.ExpatFactory.__init__() when make_instance()
       is called many times.  Still, rather than:

         newNode = gnosis.xml.objectify.make_instance('<TD/>')

       it is certainly better to use:

         newNode = gnosis.xml.objectify.createPyObj('TD')

       ...which avoids the prior issue anyway.

       Added convenience function addChild(),

       Silly fixes in pyobj_printer() for Python version oddness

       For Python 2.3+, need to skip DocumentType nodes in
       pyobj_from_dom() function.

       Fixed/improved test cases.

01/05: Adam Feuer fixed two bugs causing leaks in long running
       processes (file close and expat base class).

       Created support functions in gnosis.xml.objectify.utils.
       See gnosis/docs/xml_matters_39.txt for more discussion.

       - addChild()  # moved to utils subpackage
       - walk_xo()   # Recursively traverse the nodes 
       - write_xml() # Serialize an _XO_ object back into XML
       - XPath()     # Find node(s) within an _XO_ object
       - pyobj_printer()  # moved to utils subpackage 

       Significant speedups by miscellaneous refactoring/cleanup.
