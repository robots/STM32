Convert ASCII source files for HTML presentation

    This file is released to the public domain.  I (dqm) would
    appreciate it if you choose to keep derived works under terms
    that promote freedom, but obviously am giving up any rights
    to compel such.



  This program is not yet particularly smart, and will produce
  undefined output (or even traceback) if the source file does
  not meet expected format.  With time, it may get better about
  this.

      #------------------- Shell Usage -----------------------#
      Usage: python dmTxt2Html.py [options] [filename]    (or)
             txt2html.cgi [options] [filename]

          -h, /h, -?, /?, ?:   Show this help screen
          -type:<type>:        Set conversion type
                               (see discussion of types)
          -REBUILD_DOCS:       Generate 'txt2html.txt'
          -out:<out>:          Output filename (default STDOUT)
          -proxy:<mode>:       Use proxy element(s) in output
          <STDIN>, -, /:       Input from STDIN (default)

      Proxy modes are:  NAVIGATOR, TRAP_LINKS, ALL, NONE.
      Elements are "navigation bar" at top of pages and
      virtualization of in-page links.  Shell default in NONE.

      Note: CGI is detected by the absence of arguments;, if
            all defaults are wanted, specify STDIN explicitly:

          python txt2html.py - < MyArticle.txt > MyArticle.html
-
      #-------------------- CGI Usage ------------------------#
      Usage: A URL string may be composed manually, but the
             normal usage will be to call txt2html.cgi from an
             HTML form with the fields:  'source', 'preface,
             'type', 'proxy'.  'preface' allows explicit
             overriding of HTTP headers in the returned page,
             normally as a hidden field.  Use with caution (or
             don't use at all, the default is sensible).

      Example: <form method="get" action="http://gnosis.cx/cgi/txt2html.cgi">
               URL: <input type="text" name="source" size=40>
               <input type="submit" name="go" value="Display!"></form>

Expected input format for [HTML]

  Source HTML is presented unmodified except for the inclusion
  of the Txt2HTML proxy at the top of each page.

Expected input format for [PYTHON]

   Source Python code is marked up with syntax highlighting, but
   no other HTML elements are introduced (no headers, no bold, no
   URLs, etc)

Expected input format for [SMART_ASCII]

      #--- Paragraph rules: ---#
      - Title occurs on first line of document, unindented and in
        all caps.
      - Subtitle occurs on second line, unindented and in mixed
        case.
      - Name, affiliation, date occur, unindented and in mixed
        case, on lines 4-6.
      - Section headings are preceded by two blank lines,
        unindented, in all caps, followed by one line of 72
        dashes and one blank line.
      - Regular text paragraphs are block style, and are indented
        two spaces.
      - Block quotations are indented four spaces, rather than
        the two of original text.
      - Code samples are indented six spaces (with internal
        indentation of code lines in the proper relative
        position).
      - Code samples may begin with a line indicating a title for
        that block.  If present, this title is indented the same
        six spaces as the rest of the block, and begins and ends
        with a pound sign ('#').  Dashes are used to fill space
        within the title for ASCII asthetics.
-
      #--- Character rules: ---#
      - All character markup has the pattern:
            whitespace-symbol-words(s)-symbol-whitespace
        Examples are given, and this can be searched for
        programmatically.  The use of character markup applies
        *only* to text paragraphs, *not* to code samples!
      - Asterisks are used for an inflectional emphasis.  For
        example, "All good boys *deserve* fudge."  This would
        typically be indicated typographically with boldface or
        italics.
      - Underscores are used for book/journal citation.  For
        example, "Knuth's _Art of Computer Programming_ is
        essential."  This would typically be indicated
        typographically with italics or underline.
      - Single-stroke is used to indicate filenames and function
        names.  For example, "Every C program has a 'main()'
        function."  This might be indicated typographically by a
        fixed font, by boldface, or simply by single-quotes.
      - Braces are used to indicate a module, package or library.
        For example, "The [cre] module will replace [re] in
        Python 1.6."  This will probably be indicated
        typographically as a fixed font.
      - Double-stroke is used as either inline quotation or scare
        quotes.  For example, "It may not be as "easy" as
        suggested."  In either case, typographic quotes are
        probably the best format; italics would make some sense
        also.
      - Parenthesis are used, and should be preserved as is.
      - Angle brackets and curly brackets have no special meaning
        yet.  I may choose to use those if there is something I
        think the above forms do not capture.
      - Em-dashes, diacritics, ligatures, and typographic
        quotations are not available, and standard ASCII
        approximations are used.
-
      #--- Miscellany: ---#
      - URL's are automatically transformed into a hotlink.
        Basically, anything that starts with 'http://', 'ftp://',
        'file://' or 'gopher://' looks like a URL to the program.


  This script utilizes the services of the Marc-Andre Lemburg's Python
  Highlighter for HTML (v0.5+) [py2html].  [py2html] in turn relies on
  Just van Rossum's [PyFontify] (v.0.3.1+) If these are not present,
  Txt2HTML hopes to degrade gracefully, but will not provide syntax
  highlighting for Python source code.
